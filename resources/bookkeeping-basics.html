        <h1>Small Business Bookkeeping Basics - Your Getting Started Guide</h1>
        <p class="resource-intro">Clean books aren't just for tax time. They help you make better decisions, get approved for loans, and avoid costly IRS issues. Whether you're just starting out or cleaning up years of disorganized records, this guide covers the fundamentals every business owner needs to know.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="guide-content">

        <!-- Why Bookkeeping Matters -->
        <div class="guide-section">
          <h2>Why Bookkeeping Matters</h2>
          <p>Many small business owners treat bookkeeping as a chore they'll "get to eventually." But disorganized finances cost you real money - in missed deductions, penalty fees, and poor decisions made without accurate data. Here's what solid bookkeeping actually gives you:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Cash flow visibility</strong> - Know exactly how much money is coming in and going out every month. No more guessing whether you can afford that new hire or equipment purchase.</li>
            <li><strong>Tax preparation ease</strong> - When your books are clean, tax prep takes hours instead of weeks. Your CPA spends less time sorting through receipts and more time finding you deductions.</li>
            <li><strong>Loan readiness</strong> - Banks and lenders require organized financial statements. If you can't produce a profit and loss statement on demand, you're not ready for financing.</li>
            <li><strong>Audit protection</strong> - If the IRS comes knocking, clean books are your best defense. Disorganized records raise red flags and lead to longer, more expensive audits.</li>
            <li><strong>Better decision-making</strong> - You can't improve what you don't measure. Accurate financials tell you which services are profitable, which clients are costing you money, and where to invest next.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- Cash vs. Accrual Accounting -->
        <div class="guide-section">
          <h2>Cash vs. Accrual Accounting</h2>
          <p>One of the first decisions you'll make is which accounting method to use. This choice affects when you record income and expenses, which directly impacts your tax liability.</p>

          <div class="comparison-grid">
            <div class="comparison-card">
              <h3>Cash Basis</h3>
              <p><strong>Record income when received.</strong> Record expenses when paid. If a client owes you $5,000 but hasn't paid yet, it's not income until the check clears.</p>
              <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Simpler to maintain. Gives a clear picture of actual cash on hand. Easier for tax planning since you can time income and expenses.</p>
              <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Can distort your financial picture. A big month of collections might look profitable even if you haven't earned new revenue.</p>
              <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Small businesses under $25M in annual revenue without inventory.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="comparison-card">
              <h3>Accrual Basis</h3>
              <p><strong>Record income when earned.</strong> Record expenses when incurred. That $5,000 invoice counts as income the moment you send it, even before the client pays.</p>
              <p><strong>Pros:</strong> More accurate financial picture. Matches revenue to the period it was earned. Required for GAAP compliance.</p>
              <p><strong>Cons:</strong> More complex. You might owe taxes on income you haven't collected yet. Requires tracking accounts receivable and payable.</p>
              <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Businesses with inventory, businesses over $25M revenue, or anyone wanting a more accurate financial picture.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="pro-tip">
            <h4>Which Should You Choose?</h4>
            <p>Most small businesses start with cash basis - it's simpler and gives you more control over tax timing. Consider switching to accrual when you start carrying inventory, when you have significant accounts receivable, or when you need more accurate financial statements for investors or lenders. Talk to your CPA before switching - the change requires IRS approval (Form 3115).</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Chart of Accounts -->
        <div class="guide-section">
          <h2>Setting Up Your Chart of Accounts</h2>
          <p>Your chart of accounts is the backbone of your bookkeeping system. It's a categorized list of every account where money flows in or out of your business. Every transaction gets recorded to one of these accounts. There are five main categories:</p>

          <div class="account-category">
            <h3>1. Assets - What You Own</h3>
            <p>Bank accounts (checking, savings), accounts receivable (money owed to you), equipment, vehicles, inventory, prepaid expenses. These represent value your business holds.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="account-category">
            <h3>2. Liabilities - What You Owe</h3>
            <p>Credit card balances, business loans, lines of credit, accounts payable (bills you owe), payroll taxes payable, sales tax collected but not yet remitted. These are your financial obligations.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="account-category">
            <h3>3. Equity - Owner's Stake</h3>
            <p>Owner's investment (capital contributions), owner's draws (money taken out), retained earnings (accumulated profits). Equity equals assets minus liabilities.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="account-category">
            <h3>4. Revenue - Money Coming In</h3>
            <p>Sales revenue, service income, consulting fees, interest income, rental income. Keep different revenue streams in separate accounts so you can track what's actually making money.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="account-category">
            <h3>5. Expenses - Money Going Out</h3>
            <p>Rent, utilities, payroll, office supplies, insurance, marketing, professional fees, travel, meals, software subscriptions. The more specific your expense categories, the easier tax prep becomes.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="pro-tip">
            <h4>Pro Tip</h4>
            <p>Don't create too many accounts - it makes categorizing transactions a chore. But don't have too few either - lumping everything into "miscellaneous" defeats the purpose. For most small businesses, 30-50 accounts is the sweet spot. Your accounting software will come with a default chart of accounts that you can customize.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Monthly Tasks -->
        <div class="guide-section">
          <h2>Essential Monthly Tasks</h2>
          <p>Consistency is the key to clean books. Block out 2-3 hours at the end of each month to complete these tasks. If you let them pile up, you'll spend days catching up at year-end.</p>
          <ul class="checklist">
            <li>&#9744; Reconcile all bank accounts against your records</li>
            <li>&#9744; Reconcile all credit card statements</li>
            <li>&#9744; Categorize every transaction - no "uncategorized" entries left</li>
            <li>&#9744; Send invoices for all outstanding work completed this month</li>
            <li>&#9744; Follow up on unpaid invoices over 30 days old</li>
            <li>&#9744; Review accounts payable - pay bills on time to maintain vendor relationships</li>
            <li>&#9744; Back up your accounting data (cloud and/or local backup)</li>
            <li>&#9744; Review your profit and loss statement - are you actually making money this month?</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- Quarterly Tasks -->
        <div class="guide-section">
          <h2>Quarterly Tasks</h2>
          <p>Every three months, step back and look at the bigger picture. Quarterly reviews help you catch problems early and make adjustments before they become expensive.</p>
          <ul class="checklist">
            <li>&#9744; Review quarterly financial statements (P&L, balance sheet, cash flow)</li>
            <li>&#9744; Compare actual revenue and expenses vs. your budget</li>
            <li>&#9744; Make estimated tax payments if applicable (due Apr 15, Jun 15, Sep 15, Jan 15)</li>
            <li>&#9744; Review and adjust pricing if costs have increased</li>
            <li>&#9744; Clean up any uncategorized or miscategorized transactions</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- Year-End Tasks -->
        <div class="guide-section">
          <h2>Year-End Tasks</h2>
          <p>Year-end is crunch time. Complete these tasks before the new year starts - your future self (and your CPA) will thank you.</p>
          <ul class="checklist">
            <li>&#9744; Reconcile all accounts through December 31</li>
            <li>&#9744; Gather W-9 forms and organize 1099 information for all contractors paid $600+</li>
            <li>&#9744; Review depreciation schedules for equipment and vehicles</li>
            <li>&#9744; Maximize deductions - prepay expenses, make equipment purchases before Dec 31</li>
            <li>&#9744; Send W-2 forms to employees by January 31</li>
            <li>&#9744; Send 1099-NEC forms to contractors by January 31</li>
            <li>&#9744; Review retirement plan contributions and maximize if possible</li>
            <li>&#9744; Close the books - once finalized, no more changes to the prior year</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- Common Mistakes -->
        <div class="guide-section">
          <h2>Common Bookkeeping Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
          <p>We see these same mistakes over and over again. Avoiding them will save you thousands in tax prep fees, missed deductions, and IRS penalties.</p>
          <ol class="mistakes-list">
            <li><strong>Mixing personal and business expenses.</strong> This is the number one mistake. Use a dedicated business bank account and credit card. When you run personal expenses through your business, it creates a messy paper trail and can jeopardize your liability protection (especially for LLCs and S-Corps).</li>
            <li><strong>Not keeping receipts.</strong> The IRS requires documentation for all business expenses. Digital receipts count - use an app to photograph receipts the day you get them. Without receipts, deductions get denied in an audit.</li>
            <li><strong>Categorizing everything as "miscellaneous."</strong> If 40% of your expenses are "other" or "miscellaneous," you're losing valuable tax insights. Take the extra 10 seconds to categorize properly.</li>
            <li><strong>Forgetting to record cash transactions.</strong> Cash income is still taxable. Cash expenses are still deductible. Write them down or they disappear - and unrecorded cash income is a major audit trigger.</li>
            <li><strong>Not reconciling monthly.</strong> If you only reconcile at year-end, you'll find errors that are months old and nearly impossible to trace. Monthly reconciliation catches mistakes when they're still fresh.</li>
            <li><strong>Ignoring accounts receivable aging.</strong> An invoice from 90 days ago is much harder to collect than one from 30 days ago. Review your aging report monthly and follow up on overdue accounts immediately.</li>
          </ol>
        </div>

            <h4>Our Recommendation</h4>
            <p>We work with all major accounting platforms, but QuickBooks Online is our most common recommendation for small businesses.
