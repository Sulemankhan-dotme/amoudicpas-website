      <h1>Top Tax Deductions Small Business Owners Miss</h1>
      <p class="deductions-intro">Most small business owners leave money on the table every year. After reviewing hundreds of returns, our CPA team consistently finds these deductions being underused or completely overlooked. Here is your guide to claiming everything you are entitled to.</p>

      <!-- Home Office Deduction -->
      <div class="deduction-card">
        <h3><span class="deduction-icon">1</span> Home Office Deduction</h3>
        <p>If you use a dedicated space in your home regularly and exclusively for business, you qualify for the home office deduction. There are two methods:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Simplified method:</strong> $5 per square foot of your home office, up to 300 square feet. Maximum deduction: $1,500. No need to track actual expenses.</li>
          <li><strong>Actual expense method:</strong> Calculate the percentage of your home used for business, then deduct that percentage of your rent or mortgage interest, utilities, insurance, repairs, and depreciation.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The space must be used regularly and exclusively for business. A guest bedroom that doubles as an office does not qualify. A dedicated room with a desk and no bed does.</p>
        <div class="potential-savings">Potential Savings: $1,500 - $5,000+ per year depending on method and home costs</div>
      </div>

      <!-- Vehicle & Mileage -->
      <div class="deduction-card">
        <h3><span class="deduction-icon">2</span> Vehicle &amp; Mileage</h3>
        <p>Every mile you drive for business purposes is deductible. The 2025 IRS standard mileage rate is <strong>70 cents per mile</strong> (the 2026 rate is typically announced in December and may change). You can use either:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Standard mileage rate:</strong> Multiply your business miles by the IRS rate. Simple, requires a mileage log.</li>
          <li><strong>Actual expense method:</strong> Track gas, insurance, repairs, depreciation, lease payments, and registration. Deduct the business-use percentage.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Do not forget to include <strong>parking fees and tolls</strong> - these are deductible on top of either method. Commuting from home to a regular office is not deductible, but driving between client sites, to the bank, or to the office supply store all count.</p>
        <p><strong>Keep a mileage log.</strong> Record the date, starting location, destination, business purpose, and miles for each trip. Apps like MileIQ or a simple spreadsheet work fine. Without a log, the IRS can disallow your entire mileage deduction.</p>
        <div class="potential-savings">Potential Savings: $3,500 - $10,000+ per year (5,000 - 15,000 business miles is common)</div>
      </div>

      <!-- Health Insurance Premiums -->
      <div class="deduction-card">
        <h3><span class="deduction-icon">3</span> Health Insurance Premiums</h3>
        <p>If you are self-employed and not eligible for coverage through a spouse's employer plan, you can deduct <strong>100% of your health, dental, and vision insurance premiums</strong> for yourself, your spouse, and your dependents.</p>
        <p>This is an <strong>above-the-line deduction</strong>, meaning it reduces your adjusted gross income (AGI) directly - you do not need to itemize to claim it. It also reduces your self-employment tax base indirectly by lowering your income.</p>
        <p>This deduction applies whether you purchase insurance through the marketplace, a private insurer, or a professional association plan. It does not apply to months where you were eligible for employer-subsidized coverage.</p>
        <div class="potential-savings">Potential Savings: $5,000 - $20,000+ per year for a family plan</div>
      </div>

      <!-- Retirement Contributions -->
      <div class="deduction-card">
        <h3><span class="deduction-icon">4</span> Retirement Contributions</h3>
        <p>Contributing to a retirement plan is one of the most powerful tax deductions available to self-employed individuals. You get an immediate deduction plus tax-deferred growth on your investments.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>SEP-IRA:</strong> Contribute up to 25% of net self-employment earnings, with a maximum of approximately $69,000 for 2025. Simple to set up, no employee matching requirements if you are a sole proprietor.</li>
          <li><strong>Solo 401(k):</strong> Allows both employee deferrals (up to $23,500 for 2025, plus $7,500 catch-up if 50+) and employer profit-sharing contributions. Total limit around $69,000. Best for maximizing contributions at lower income levels.</li>
          <li><strong>SIMPLE IRA:</strong> Employee deferral up to $16,500 for 2025. Good option if you have a small number of employees.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Many business owners do not realize they can still set up and fund a SEP-IRA for the prior year up until the tax filing deadline (including extensions).</p>
        <div class="potential-savings">Potential Savings: $5,000 - $20,000+ in tax savings depending on contribution and tax bracket</div>
      </div>

      <!-- Business Meals -->
      <div class="deduction-card">
        <h3><span class="deduction-icon">5</span> Business Meals</h3>
        <p>Business meals are <strong>50% deductible</strong> when directly related to or associated with your trade or business. This includes meals with clients, prospects, vendors, and employees when business is discussed.</p>
        <p>To substantiate the deduction, keep records of:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The amount and date of the expense</li>
          <li>The name and business relationship of the person(s) you dined with</li>
          <li>The business purpose or topic discussed</li>
          <li>The name and location of the restaurant</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Write these details on the back of the receipt or log them in an app immediately. A credit card statement alone is not sufficient documentation.</p>
        <div class="potential-savings">Potential Savings: $500 - $3,000+ per year depending on frequency of business meals</div>
      </div>

      <!-- Professional Development -->
      <div class="deduction-card">
        <h3><span class="deduction-icon">6</span> Professional Development</h3>
        <p>Education and training expenses that maintain or improve skills required in your current business are fully deductible. This includes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Online courses, workshops, and webinars related to your industry</li>
          <li>Professional conferences and seminars (including travel, lodging, and registration fees)</li>
          <li>Books, audiobooks, and trade publications</li>
          <li>Professional certifications and license renewals</li>
          <li>Coaching and mastermind programs related to business growth</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The key requirement is that the education must relate to your current business. An accountant taking an advanced tax course qualifies. An accountant taking a course to become a dentist does not.</p>
        <div class="potential-savings">Potential Savings: $500 - $5,000+ per year</div>
      </div>

      <!-- Software & Subscriptions -->
      <div class="deduction-card">
        <h3><span class="deduction-icon">7</span> Software &amp; Subscriptions</h3>
        <p>Nearly every business relies on software tools today, and most of those subscriptions are deductible. Common examples include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Accounting:</strong> QuickBooks, FreshBooks, Wave, Xero</li>
          <li><strong>Productivity:</strong> Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, Notion</li>
          <li><strong>Design:</strong> Adobe Creative Cloud, Canva Pro, Figma</li>
          <li><strong>Project management:</strong> Asana, Monday.com, Basecamp</li>
          <li><strong>Website:</strong> Hosting fees, domain name renewals, WordPress plugins, Shopify subscriptions</li>
          <li><strong>Communication:</strong> Zoom, Slack, phone service plans used for business</li>
          <li><strong>Marketing:</strong> Email marketing platforms, social media schedulers, SEO tools</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If a subscription is used for both personal and business purposes (like a phone plan), deduct only the business-use percentage.</p>
        <div class="potential-savings">Potential Savings: $1,000 - $5,000+ per year</div>
      </div>

      <!-- Professional Services -->
      <div class="deduction-card">
        <h3><span class="deduction-icon">8</span> Professional Services</h3>
        <p>Fees paid to professionals who help you run your business are fully deductible. This includes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>CPA and accounting fees</strong> for tax preparation, bookkeeping, and advisory services</li>
          <li><strong>Attorney fees</strong> for contract review, business formation, trademark registration, or other legal services</li>
          <li><strong>Business consulting fees</strong> for marketing consultants, business coaches, HR advisors, and IT professionals</li>
          <li><strong>Payroll processing fees</strong> charged by your payroll provider</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Even the fee you pay to have your business tax return prepared is deductible. Keep all invoices and receipts from your service providers.</p>
        <div class="potential-savings">Potential Savings: $1,000 - $5,000+ per year</div>
      </div>

      <!-- Depreciation / Section 179 -->
      <div class="deduction-card">
        <h3><span class="deduction-icon">9</span> Depreciation &amp; Section 179</h3>
        <p>When you purchase equipment, furniture, vehicles, or software for your business, you can often deduct the full cost in the year of purchase rather than spreading it over several years. The <strong>One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA)</strong> significantly expanded these provisions.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Section 179:</strong> Under the OBBBA, the annual deduction limit has been increased to <strong>$2.5 million</strong>, with the phase-out beginning at <strong>$4 million</strong> of total qualifying purchases. These enhanced limits apply to property placed in service after December 31, 2024, and the thresholds are indexed for inflation in future years. This covers computers, office furniture, machinery, vehicles (with limits), and off-the-shelf software.</li>
          <li><strong>Bonus depreciation:</strong> The OBBBA <strong>permanently reinstated 100% bonus depreciation</strong> for qualifying property acquired and placed in service after January 19, 2025. This applies to both new and used eligible assets. Note: taxpayers may elect a lower bonus depreciation percentage for the first taxable year ending after that date as a transitional measure.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> A $10,000 computer system can be fully deducted in Year 1 under either Section 179 or 100% bonus depreciation. Without these provisions, you would depreciate the system over 5 years at just $2,000 per year.</p>
        <div class="potential-savings">Potential Savings: Varies widely - a $50,000 equipment purchase could save $12,000 - $18,500 in taxes in Year 1</div>
      </div>

      <!-- Business Insurance -->
      <div class="deduction-card">
        <h3><span class="deduction-icon">10</span> Business Insurance</h3>
        <p>Premiums paid for insurance that protects your business are fully deductible as ordinary and necessary business expenses. Commonly deductible policies include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>General liability insurance</strong> - protects against claims of bodily injury or property damage</li>
          <li><strong>Professional liability (errors & omissions) insurance</strong> - covers claims of negligence or mistakes in professional services</li>
          <li><strong>Business property insurance</strong> - protects your equipment, inventory, and office space</li>
          <li><strong>Commercial auto insurance</strong> - for vehicles used in business operations</li>
          <li><strong>Workers' compensation insurance</strong> - required in most states if you have employees</li>
          <li><strong>Cyber liability insurance</strong> - covers data breaches and cyberattacks</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you have a home-based business, your homeowner's policy does not cover business property or liability. A separate business policy is both a smart investment and a deductible expense.</p>
        <div class="potential-savings">Potential Savings: $500 - $5,000+ per year depending on coverage levels</div>
      </div>

      <!-- Warning Box -->
      <div class="warning-box">
        <strong>Important: Keep Your Documentation</strong>
        <p>Always keep receipts and documentation for every business deduction you claim. The IRS requires substantiation for all business expenses, and in an audit, the burden of proof is on you. A good rule of thumb: if you cannot prove it, do not deduct it. Digital copies of receipts are acceptable - use a scanner app or dedicated expense-tracking software to stay organized throughout the year.</p>
